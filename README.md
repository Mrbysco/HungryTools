# Hungry Tools #

## About ##
Ever wanted your tools to be more than just a tool? Ever wanted them to obtain the ability to consume blocks or items? No? Well, too bad!
Hungry Tools lets your tools consume blocks or items related to their type. 
Tools can crave a specific item or block, refusing others until satisfied. 
Each tool also has a random item it cannot consume due to an allergy.
